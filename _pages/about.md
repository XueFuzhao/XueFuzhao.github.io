My name is Fuzhao Xue, which is pronounced as Full-Draw Xue in English. Alternatively, you may call me Frio if you prefer. I'm a PhD candidate of [HPC-AI](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) at National University of Singapore (NUS). I hold an MEng degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), where I achieved outstanding academic performance with a perfect GPA of 5.0/5.0 in 2021. During my master's studies, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof Eng Siong Chng](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/default.html/) & [Prof Aixin Sun](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/). 

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege to collaborate with exceptionally talented scientists in various companies. Previously, I worked as a student researcher at  [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), under the guidance of [Yi Tay](https://vanzytay.github.io/) and [Mostafa Dehghani](https://mostafadehghani.com/).Currently, I am a research intern at [NVIDIA AI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/ai-data-science/), working alongside [Jim Fan](https://jimfan.me/) and [Yuke Zhu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~yukez/). Please check my [CV](/cv.pdf) for further information. 

My research is generously supported by the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/).

I'm actively looking for a few **undergrad/master students** to work together. Feel free to drop me an email with your CV if you are interested in foundation model research!


Research
------
My current research mainly focus on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and High Performance Computing. One recent interest is designing algorithm and system to train efficient large language model and other foundation models (e.g. vision, embodied agent). I am always happy to chat about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.

Personal information
------
Personal Hobbies: basketball, fitness and cooking. I also enjoy watching movies and listening to music, although, unfortunately, I'm a terrible singer. Fortunately, I think I have a gift for cooking. Maybe you can say Fuzhao (Frio) is zero-shot cooking learner. :)
Another interesting thing is: I have the chance to be Newton's eighteenth generation of students. The acadamic family tree is [here](/AcademicFamilyTree.pdf). Looking forward to the day!
